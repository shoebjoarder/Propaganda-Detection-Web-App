# Propaganda-Detection-Web-App
This is an extension of my master project at the University of Duisburg-Essen. The motivation of the master project was to detect the propaganda articles in websites. The project was highly successful. This is a personal project to make the propaganda detection at article level in a personalized web application. Users can input a text located in home page and predict using a binary classifier ("propaganda" or "non-propaganda"). 

### TODO
- guide to create the model
- make the website ready
- create a docker image with dependencies installed and upload it in docker hub
- create a docker image for this web application
